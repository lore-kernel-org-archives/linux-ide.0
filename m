	fn(dest, src)

is a well-known C idiom which the kernel went and broke in lots of places :(

It maps nicely onto

	dest = src

as a mnemonic.

But given that the compiler will reliably barf if they are backwards
it's a minor thing.

We'll live.

(I'm not a big fan of the patches, btw.  It's more of an "oh groan,
because it's there I suppose we really ought to do this" sort of thing.
(strong objections would save me a lot of work (looks hopefully at
inbox))).
