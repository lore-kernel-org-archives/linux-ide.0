..

Exactly my point.  With the "improved" version, I now have to go
hunting for yet another macro in yet another header file in order
to see what the code is doing and to verify correctness.
And I (and other reviewers) are just a teensy bit less likely to
follow through with that every time, meaning we'll miss bugs.

This is somewhat akin to Linus's dislike of typedefs for structs.
It just hides what's really going on, for no obvious gain.  Sorry.  :)

Cheers
