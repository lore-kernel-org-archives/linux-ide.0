On the ARM implementation we are safe with regards to spinlocks/mutexes
vs. IO accesses, no weird ordering issues here (if there would be, I
agree that it would need fixing).

So if that's the API for the above case and we are strictly referring to
the sata_sil24 patch I sent - shouldn't we just add wmb() in the driver
between the write to the DMA buffer and the writel() to start the DMA
transfer? Do we need to move the wmb() to the writel() macro?
