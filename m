It currently happens in CFQ, since that is what deals with priorities.
But we should just make that the case, generically. The rule is that if
priority is set in a bio, that is what we'll use. But if not, we'll
use what the application has set in general, and that is available in
the io context.

Agree, see above, it should just happen generically.

At that point it should be a driver knob, it's not something that should
be part of the generic block layer.
