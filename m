Have you measured the impact of setting the PCI dma mask to 32-bit?

Last time Alex Williamson (HP) measured this on IA64, we deliberately
forced pci_map_sg() to use the IOMMU even for devices that were 64-bit
capable. We got 3-5% better throughput since the device had fewer
entries to retrieve and the devices (at the time) weren't that good at
processing SG lists.

I'm pretty sure that's not possible (using two PCI dev structs). I'm
skeptical it's worth converting DMA services to use SCSI devs since
that's an extremely invasive change for a marginal benefit.
