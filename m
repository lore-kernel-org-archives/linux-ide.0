Well yes, but you don't have to worry about that when reviewing because
you know the compiler will catch reversals.

Still not terribly keen about it all, but geeze the code which it is
trying to clarify is godawful:

	*(__le32 *)(buf + i) = cpu_to_le32(addr);

wtf?

Then again the replacement

	put_le32(addr, (__le32 *)(buf + i));

is still wtf.
