Isn't that more hacky?  I don't know.  All that dm needs to know is
the location of the metadata which is located w.r.t. the end of the
device which might be at a different location if BIOS tried to pull
silly stunts.  So, exporting the size BIOS might have used seems like
a straight forward solution to me.

Thanks.
