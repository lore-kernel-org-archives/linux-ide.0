Kernels for the HP simulator (ski) use a SCSI model, not IDE,
so they should be OK.

The SGI simulator *does* use IDE, and this will break that.  But
my friends at SGI are looking at exposing the simulated IDE device
via PCI, which should fix it.

PCMCIA might be of theoretical interest, but not important enough
by itself to keep IDE_ARCH_OBSOLETE_INIT, IMHO.  And it sounds like
ide-cs can be fixed fairly easily to not depend on it.

I'm not aware of any ide-pnp devices on IA64, so I don't think this
is a problem for us.  The SGI simulator could use ide-pnp via
PNPACPI, but ordering shouldn't be a problem there.

But it is interesting that PNP IDE devices are discovered *after*
PCI devices.  For serial, we do PNP before PCI, on the theory that
PNP devices are usually built-in and shouldn't move if you just plug
in a new PCI card.

HDIO_SCAN_HWIF - I don't know about this one.  How are we supposed to
follow the "new ports shouldn't define IDE_ARCH_OBSOLETE_INIT" injunction
if we lose all this functionality without it?  ia64 is about as close to
a new port as you get :-)

IDE on ia64 is little-used, so I'm OK with leaving it alone, but
I do think it's wrong for an architecture with no real restriction
to specify MAX_HWIFS in ide.h.  Better to have the config option,
and make the default there larger if necessary.

OK, I'll split this and look into it a bit more.

Huh?  The first patch I posted did exactly that, nothing more.  But
Alan pointed out that I should instead clean up asm-ia64/ide.h, which
I think leads to a nicer solution.

Thanks for the detailed comments!
