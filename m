I have a strong preference for making this a tunable for the following 
reason. I am concerned that this could negatively impact performance if this 
feature is not properly implemented on a device. In addition, this feature 
can make a dramatic difference in the performance of prioritized vs 
non-prioritized IO. Priority IO is improved, but it comes at the cost of 
non-prioritized IO. If someone has tuned a system in such a way that things 
work well as is, I do not want to cause any surprises.

I can see the argument for not having the tunable in the block layer, but 
then we need to add a tunable to all request based drivers that may leverage
the iopriority information. This has the potential to generate a lot more 
code and documentation.  I also would like to use the tunable when the 
iopriority is set on the request so we can preserve the default behavior. 
This can be a concern when we have drivers that use request iopriority 
information, such as the fusion mptsas driver.

I will also document the tunable :) if we agree that it is necessary.

Ouch, this will be cleaned up in the next revision.

I caught this in the explanation of the first patch I sent out. I am still
assuming that this will be a tunable, but I will have the bio_prio take 
precedence in the next patch.

Will do.
