I replied about this in a separate sub-thread, but you may not have been
on the direct Cc (though linux-ide should have been).

This all began because I noticed one of my automated test machines had
not successfully booted a kernel in some time. I investigated via
bisection and found that CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME=y was broken on my IA64 box.
With Tony and Peter Z's help, that bug was resolved, but then with the
console working, I noticed these unaligned accesses. Sorry if it seemed
like, from my posting, they were a regression, I did not mean to give
that impression.

They may have been there for some time, but I don't have any logs from
kernels before 2.6.27-rc3, because of the CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME=y breakage
(which was being set by default for this box). I could go back and try
older kernels, if you'd like, but it would take some time.

Thanks,
Nish
