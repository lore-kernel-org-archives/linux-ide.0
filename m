I think you just admitted that the new version is less readable.  At
least with an '=' operator you know which side is the thing that's
being modified.  With a put_XXX function, I would have to go look up
the definition (particularly since outb et al. are also the wrong way
around, i.e. have the destination as the second argument).

Plus we have a common idiom that get_*() functions increment some sort
of reference count, and put_*() functions decrease a reference count
and may free something...
