Hi everyone,

I'm having a problem with data corruption using devmapper on a SATA
disk using sata_sil24.  I've done some work tracking it down, and
hopefully you folks can point me further in the right direction.

The kernel I'm using is 2.6.21-1.3228.fc7 (i.e. Fedora 7).  LVM2 is
lvm2-2.02.24-1.fc7.  The dmsetup and libdevmapper is
device-mapper-1.02.17-7.fc7.

The original setup that showed the problem is this:

Starting with two 500GB SATA drives (interface card uses a Silicon
3124 chipset), /dev/sdd and /dev/sde.  I partitioned each into two
250GB chunks (250*1000*1000*1000, not 250*1024*1024*1024), and set up
two RAID 1 sets such that /dev/md0 is /dev/sdd1+/dev/sde1 and /dev/md2
is /dev/sdd2+/dev/sde2.  I then created a volume group ("storage") on
top of /dev/md0 and /dev/md1.  Finally, I allocated two logical
volumes on top of that: "one" is -L300GB and "two" is -L100GB.

mke2fs -j -m0 on /dev/storage/one and /dev/storage/two, and it would
seem everything was fine, but after copying data to the two volumes,
they would fail a fsck in pretty dramatic fashion (dozens of errors
indicating pretty severe filesystem corruption).

I'll skip all the steps I tried when reducing this down to a simple
reproducible test case, but the end result is this:

1) Take a 500GB disk (as before, it's SATA plugged into a card using
   the sata_sil24 driver)

2) echo "0 482344960 linear 8:32 0" | dmsetup create one
   echo "0 209715200 linear 8:32 482345000" | dmsetup create two

3) mke2fs -j -m0 /dev/mapper/one
   mke2fs -j -m0 /dev/mapper/two
   mount /dev/mapper/one /one
   mount /dev/mapper/two /two

4) cd /one ; \
   for i in `seq 0 3`; do dd if=/dev/zero bs=4K count=1M of=$i; done ; \
   cd ; \
   umount /one

   cd /two ; \
   for i in `seq 0 3`; do dd if=/dev/zero bs=4K count=1M of=$i; done ; \
   cd ; \
   umount /two

5) fsck -f /dev/mapper/one
   fsck -f /dev/mapper/two

Both filesystems return many errors on fsck.  This is very repeatable.

Note that this simplified reproduction case uses only the device
mapper: RAID is not involved, nor is LVM.  "dmsetup table" says:

two: 0 209715200 linear 8:32 482345000
one: 0 482344960 linear 8:32 0

Just to be sure, I have run memtest86+ on the machine and badblocks on
the disk.  Both came up clean.  Partitioning the disk and mke2fs-ing
the partitions directly (i.e. no device-mapper), works fine.  It's
only when using the device-mapper does the corruption happen.  There
is nothing of interest logged in /var/log/messages or dmesg (I see the
usual messages around 'mount', but that's it).

Any suggestions?  Many thanks,

David
