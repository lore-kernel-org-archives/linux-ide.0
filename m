I looked around and thought about this and I'm not sure if this will help. 
I dug into the bio submission code and I thought generic_make_request was 
the best place to save the ioprio information. This is quite close in 
the call stack to init_request_from bio. Bcache sets the bio priority before 
the submission, so we would have to check to see if the bio priority was 
valid on bio submission leaving us with the same problem. Leaving the 
priority in the upper bits of bio->bi_rw is fine with me. It may help to 
have the bio->bi_ioprio for clarity, but I think we will still face the 
issue of having to check if this value is set when we submit the bio or 
init the request so I'm leaning towards leaving it as is.

I'm going to send out an updated series of patches summarizing some of this 
discussion and I'll also include some performance results that we have 
measured.
