Hi,
I'm sorry for late reply. I did a lot of new tests, and during it, I
noticed that one of chips gets quite hot during them (and of course it's
one without fan, and certainly one without temperature sensor, as none
of temperature sensors shown any suspicious value).
So we replaced case with few more additional fans, and since that, I didn't
get any crash. So I'm really very sorry, seems like it could have been
overheating problem all the time. I just checked CPU/general temperatures
first, so I didn't notice. I'll investigate further on the production machine,
we got those problems first and report if I find anything of interest.
with best regards
nik
