My memory is fuzzy but I thought this came up before on PPC and I also 
thought the conclusion was that the platform code (for writel, etc.) 
should enforce ordering of MMIO accesses with respect to normal RAM 
accesses. (Or maybe it was just MMIO accesses with respect to each 
other?) I don't think the answer to that question has been clearly 
documented anywhere, which is somewhat unfortunate.

If the answer is that this is needed then there are likely a lot of 
other drivers in libata and elsewhere which need to be fixed as well. 
For example, I don't see any such barriers in libahci.c when I presume 
it would need them.

IMHO, it would be better for the platform code to ensure that MMIO 
access was strongly ordered with respect to each other and to RAM 
access. Drivers are just too likely to get this wrong, especially when 
x86, the most tested platform, doesn't have such issues.
